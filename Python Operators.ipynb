What is Byte?\n","Bytes are the smallest addressable unit of memory in many computer architectures. They are used in many areas, including:\n","Programming: Used as a unit of measurement for memory and storage, as well as a means of representing data\n","Cryptography: Used to represent encrypted data, keys, and other important information\n","Computer storage is typically measured in byte multiples, such as gigabytes (GB) and terabytes (TB).\n","\n","Note:- A byte is equal to 8 bits\n","\n","2. What is a bit?\n","A bit (binary digit) is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store. A bit is always in one of two physical states, similar to an on/off light switch. The state is represented by a single binary value, usually a 0 or 1. However, the state might also be represented by yes/no, on/off or true/false.\n","\n","3. What is Kbs?\n","A kilobyte (KB) is a unit of digital information storage that is equal to about 1,000 bytes. It is used to measure the size of files, storage capacity, and data transfer rates.\n","\n","Note:- one kilobyte is 1000 bytes  and 1 megabyte is equivalent to 1,000 kilobytes.\n","\n","3. What is Mb's:-\n","One megabyte, or MB, is equivalent to 1024 kilobytes, or KB, in digital units of measurement. About a million bytes make up a megabyte (or about 1000 kilobytes). The megabyte is a multiple of the digital informational unit byte. The suggested unit symbol for it is MB\n","\n","4.  What is Gb's:-\n","GB stands for gigabyte, which is a unit of measurement for digital information storage capacity. It's commonly used in computing, technology, programming, and communications.\n","\n","Note:- One gigabyte is equal to: 1 billion bytes of data, 1,024 megabytes (MB), and 0.001 terabytes (TB).\n","\n","5. What is a Tb's:-\n","A terabyte (TB) is a unit of digital data storage that is equal to one trillion bytes. It is a relatively large unit of data volume and is commonly used to measure the capacity of storage devices and hard drives.\n","\n","Note:- Terabyte is 1,000,000,000,000 bytes, or 1,000 gigabytes\n","\n","6.
