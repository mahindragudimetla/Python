String:-**\n","String is a sequence of characters.\n","\n","Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.\n","\n","'hello' is the same as \"hello\".\n","\n","Mostly strings are immutable but the sub-strings in the strings are mutable.\n","\n","```\n","a=\"Hello World\"\n","print(a)\n","print(type(a))\n","```\n","---\n","**Index:-**\n","An index is used to print a certain characted/element from a group of elements.\n","\n","Like many other popular programming languages, strings in Python are arrays of bytes representing unicode characters.\n","\n","However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1.\n","\n","Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string\n","\n","Index is divided into 2 types:-\n","\n","1.  Positive Indexing:-\n","In Python, positive zero-based indexing is the fundamental method for accessing iterable items.\n","As a result, an index starting at 0 may refer to any element in the iterable.\n","The first element in zero-based indexing has an index of 0, the second has an index of 1, and so on.\n","It goes from right to left\n","```\n","a=\"Example\"\n","#  0123456 are the positive index values\n","print(a[4]) #out:-p\n","```\n","2.  Negative Indexing:-\n","If we wish to print the components starting at the end, we may also use negative indexes. Additionally, by specifying the index number with a negative sign, we may carry out negative tuple indexing (-). As a result, this suggests that the compiler starts thinking about the elements in reverse order, beginning with the element that comes last in the tuple.\n","```\n","a=\"Example\"\n","print(a[-6]) #out:- x\n","print(a[-3]) #out:- p\n","```\n","\n","**Slicing:-**\n","Slicing is used to print a certain group of elements using the index values.\n","\n","Syntax:- [starting index no.:ending index no.+1]\n","```\n","a=\"Examples\"\n","print(a[3:7])\n","#out:-mple\n","#prints from 3 to the 6th elements\n","```\n","```\n","a=\"Examples\"\n","print(a[-7:-2])\n","#out:-xampl\n","#prints from -7 to the -3 elements\n","```\n","\n","**String Operators:-**\n","These are of two types:-\n","1.  Concatnation(Union):-String concatenation means add strings together.\n","\n","  Use the + character to add a variable to another variable:\n","```\n","str1=\"Hello\"\n","str2=\"World\"\n","concat=str1+str2\n","#out:-\"HelloWorld\"\n","concat1=str1+\" \"+str2\n","#out:-\"Hello World\"\n","```\n","2. repetition:-\n","Use the multiplication operator (*) to repeat a string a specified number of times.\n","\n","For example, result = \"Hello, world!\" * 5 repeats the string \"Hello, world!\" five times.\n","\n","\n","```\n","a=\"hello\"\n","print(a*5)\n","#out:-hello hello hello hello hello\n","```\n","\n","**String Format:-**\n","\n","1.  .format() method:-\n","The format() method formats the specified value(s) and insert them inside the string's placeholder.\n","\n","The placeholder is defined using curly brackets: {}.
